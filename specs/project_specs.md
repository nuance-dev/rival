# RIVAL - Project Specification

## Project Overview
"RIVAL" is a next-generation web application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS v4 that displays AI model capabilities through interactive comparisons. The application showcases various AI models (Grok 3, Claude Sonnet 3.7/3.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, GPT-o1, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku/Opus, etc.) with their responses to one-shot prompts, displayed in dynamic, expandable canvases.

## Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: Minimalist yet distinctive design with subtle retro-inspired elements, drawing from industry leaders like Framer, Rive, Vercel, Linear, Supabase, Webflow, Valorant, Arc, Raycast, and Spline
- **UX Principles**: Progressive disclosure, intuitive navigation, smooth animations, Apple-inspired minimal UX ethos
- **Visual Identity**: High contrast, purposeful typography, subtle retro-inspired animations, meaningful white space
- **Content-Forward Design**: Show actual AI outputs directly on cards without requiring clicks to view content
- **Minimal Navigation**: Reduce reliance on traditional navbar, use contextual navigation and progressive disclosure
- **Immersive Gallery**: Organize content in a visually stunning grid/mosaic layout by categories on the home page
- **Seamless Interactions**: Subtle hover effects, fluid animations, and contextual expansions
- **Refined Aesthetic**: Elevated grayscale palette with strategic accent colors for hierarchy
- **Typography**: Modern, daring display fonts (Space Grotesk) for titles with clean sans-serif (Geist) for body text
- **Retro Inspiration**: Subtle CRT scan lines, pixel-perfect borders, VHS distortion effects, and terminal-inspired cursor blinks
- **Framer-Inspired Elements**: High-quality hover animations, glass effects, and fluid layout transitions

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **State Management**: React Context API + Zustand
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Animation Strategy

- **Animation Principles:**
  - Use Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations
  - Implement staggered animations for sequential elements
  - Ensure animations enhance rather than hinder the user experience
  - Fixed animation issues that were causing layout shifts and gaps
  - Added isInitialRender flag to control when animations should be applied
  - Enhanced ExpansionProvider to manage animation states more effectively
  - Simplified animation hierarchy to prevent conflicting layout calculations
