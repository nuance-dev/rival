# RIVAL

> RIVAL is a next-generation web application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS v4 that displays AI model capabilities through interactive comparisons. The application showcases various AI models (Grok 3, Claude Sonnet 3.7/3.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, GPT-o1, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku/Opus, etc.) with their responses to one-shot prompts, displayed in dynamic, expandable canvases.

RIVAL allows users to compare different AI models' responses to the same prompts, with focus on a content-forward design that displays actual AI outputs directly. The application features a voting system for model comparisons, performance analytics, and a responsive design with subtle retro-inspired animations.
