# RIVAL

> RIVAL is a next-generation web application that displays AI model capabilities through interactive comparisons. The application showcases various AI models (Grok 3, Claude Sonnet 3.7/3.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, GPT-o1, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku/Opus, etc.) with their responses to one-shot prompts, displayed in dynamic, expandable canvases.

RIVAL allows you to compare different AI models side-by-side to see how they respond to the same challenges. The application is built with Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS v4, featuring a minimalist yet distinctive design with subtle retro-inspired elements.
