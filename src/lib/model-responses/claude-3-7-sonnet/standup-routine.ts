Hey everyone! Great to be here tonight. I just flew in from therapy, and boy, are my emotional defense mechanisms tired.

I've been trying to get in shape lately. My fitness goal is to be able to climb a flight of stairs without sounding like I'm auditioning for a horror movie. You know you're out of shape when people mistake your breathing for a obscene phone call.

I downloaded one of those fitness apps that counts your steps. After a week, mine sent me a notification that said, "Are you okay? Should we call someone?" Apparently "from the couch to the fridge" isn't considered a proper workout circuit.

My doctor told me I should start eating healthier. He suggested I try the Mediterranean diet. I thought that meant pizza and ice cream, because that's what I ate when I visited Italy. Turns out, there's more to it. Who knew?

Dating in your thirties is weird. People ask different questions now. It used to be "What's your sign?" Now it's "What's your credit score?" and "How's your relationship with your mother?" I once had someone ask about my retirement plan on a first date. I was like, "My what now? I'm still trying to figure out dinner for tomorrow."

I tried online dating. My profile said I enjoy long walks on the beach. That's technically true, if by "long walks" you mean "sitting in one spot" and by "beach" you mean "my living room watching beach documentaries on Netflix."

Speaking of Netflix, I finally understand what "Netflix and chill" means. It means watching three episodes of a show, falling asleep, waking up confused during episode seven, and then spending forty minutes trying to figure out what you missed. That's romance in 2023.

I have a cat now. Getting a pet as an adult is basically announcing to the world, "I can barely take care of myself, so I've decided to be responsible for another life." My cat judges me constantly. I'll be eating ice cream straight from the container at 3 AM, and she'll just stare at me like, "This is why you're single, Karen."

Anyway, that's my time! You've been great! Remember, if you enjoyed the show, my name is [your name]. If you didn't, I'm [name of another comedian]. Good night!
