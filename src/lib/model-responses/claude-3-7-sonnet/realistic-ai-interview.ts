**Interviewer:** Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Jobs. It's 2025, and artificial intelligence has become a dominant force in technology. How do you view Apple's position in the AI landscape?

**Steve Jobs:** Look, when we approach any technology at Apple, we've always asked one fundamental question: how does this make people's lives better? AI is no different. While everyone else has been racing to show off how "smart" their AI is, we've been focused on how AI can disappear into the experience.

The best technology is invisible. It anticipates what you need before you even realize you need it. That's what we're doing with AI at Apple. Not building some chatbot that you have to talk to like it's your new best friend, but integrating intelligence so seamlessly into our products that you don't even think about it being "AI" — it's just your device working exactly as it should.

**Interviewer:** Many companies have released standalone AI assistants. Why has Apple taken a different approach?

**Steve Jobs:** Because most of these assistants are garbage. They're party tricks. They hallucinate facts, they waste your time with unnecessary conversation, and they're designed to keep you engaged with the assistant rather than helping you accomplish what you actually want to do.

We believe AI should be a tool, not a companion. It should help you do things faster, better, and with less effort. It should give you back time, not consume it. That's why we've integrated AI capabilities throughout our ecosystem rather than creating some anthropomorphized digital entity.

**Interviewer:** What about privacy concerns with AI? This has been a major issue in recent years.

**Steve Jobs:** Privacy is a fundamental human right. Period. While other companies have been harvesting every piece of data they can get their hands on to train their models, we've developed ways to deliver powerful AI capabilities without compromising user privacy.

Our on-device processing approach means your personal data stays on your device. When we do need to use the cloud, we use techniques that ensure we never see your individual data. It's more challenging to build AI this way, but it's the right thing to do.

The industry took the easy path — collect everything and figure out the privacy implications later. We took the harder path because we believe technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.

**Interviewer:** Critics say Apple has fallen behind in generative AI compared to competitors.

**Steve Jobs:** [Laughs] They said the same thing about smartphones before the iPhone, about tablets before the iPad, and about smartwatches before the Apple Watch. We're not interested in being first; we're interested in being the best.

When Apple enters a market, we do it with products that redefine categories. Our approach to AI isn't about chasing what others are doing — it's about solving real problems in ways that actually matter to people's lives.

Remember, the measure of success isn't how many features you can list on a spec sheet. It's about creating products that people love and that become essential to their daily lives. That's always been our focus, and with AI, it's no different.

**Interviewer:** What excites you most about the future of AI?

**Steve Jobs:** What excites me is how AI can amplify human creativity and capability. The most powerful use of AI isn't replacing humans — it's extending what humans can do.

I'm excited about AI that helps a musician compose in ways they never imagined, or helps a doctor spot a diagnosis they might have missed, or helps a student understand a concept that previously seemed impenetrable.

The future isn't AI taking over human tasks. It's AI and humans working together to achieve things neither could do alone. That's the vision we're building toward.

**Interviewer:** Any final thoughts on where AI technology is headed?

**Steve Jobs:** Technology should be a bicycle for the mind. AI has the potential to be the most powerful bicycle we've ever created — but only if we design it with human needs at the center.

The companies that will win in the AI era aren't those with the biggest models or the most data. They'll be the ones that use AI to solve real problems in ways that respect human autonomy, creativity, and privacy.

At Apple, we've always believed that technology should serve humanity, not control it. That philosophy is more important now than ever. And that's what will guide us as we continue to integrate AI into everything we do.
