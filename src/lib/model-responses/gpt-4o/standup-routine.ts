**(Walks on stage, looks around, shakes head.)**  
You ever wake up in the morning, stretch, take a deep breath... and immediately regret all your life choices?  

I woke up today, my body made a noise I’ve never heard before. It wasn’t a crack, it wasn’t a pop… it was more like my bones whispered, *“You did this.”*  

Aging is wild. When you’re a kid, you fall off a bike, scrape your knee, and just run it off. As an adult, I sleep *slightly* wrong, and now my neck is on strike for a week. Like, it doesn’t even negotiate. Just full-on protest mode.  

And it’s not just the body. My patience has disappeared. I was in line at the grocery store, and the guy in front of me had, I kid you not, *19 coupons*. That’s not a couponer; that’s a mathematician. He was doing long division at the register, carrying the one, solving for X… Sir, I am here for bread. I did not sign up for an SAT exam.  

Speaking of the grocery store… why is it that no matter what I buy, the cashier *always* asks, "Do you need a bag?" Like, yes. I’m buying 17 things. You think I’m gonna carry them out like some kind of overachieving circus act? Balancing a watermelon on my shoulder, eggs under my chin?  

And self-checkout? That’s just unpaid labor. I scanned three things, and the machine had the nerve to say, *“Unexpected item in the bagging area.”* First of all, *you* put the bag there. Second, don’t make me feel like I’m stealing when I *clearly* don’t have the coordination for crime.  

Look, I know my limits. I’m not built for a life of crime. I can’t even jaywalk without looking both ways five times. Like, I’ll see an empty road and still be like, *“Mmm… let me wait.”* Meanwhile, some 80-year-old woman is just strolling past me like she owns the city. I saw a guy jaywalk in New York without even looking up from his phone. That’s next-level confidence. That’s a man who has made peace with whatever happens.  

I respect it. I really do.  

Anyway, thanks for listening to me complain. I hope all your bones stay silent tonight.
