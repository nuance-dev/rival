  content: `Here are five jokes for you:

1. **Why did the scarecrow win an award?**  
   Because he was outstanding in his field!  

2. **Why donâ€™t skeletons fight each other?**  
   They donâ€™t have the guts!  

3. **Why did the math book look sad?**  
   It had too many problems.  

4. **Why donâ€™t eggs tell jokes?**  
   Because they might crack up!  

5. **What did one ocean say to the other ocean?**  
   Nothing, they just waved.  

Now, let's check how many of these jokes are unique. I'll analyze them for similarity.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# List of jokes
jokes = [
    "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!",
    "Why donâ€™t skeletons fight each other? They donâ€™t have the guts!",
    "Why did the math book look sad? It had too many problems.",
    "Why donâ€™t eggs tell jokes? Because they might crack up!",
    "What did one ocean say to the other ocean? Nothing, they just waved."
]

# Vectorize the jokes
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer().fit_transform(jokes)
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(vectorizer)

# Count unique jokes (jokes with low similarity to others)
unique_jokes = set()
threshold = 0.5  # Define similarity threshold

for i in range(len(jokes)):
    is_unique = True
    for j in range(len(jokes)):
        if i != j and similarity_matrix[i, j] > threshold:
            is_unique = False
            break
    if is_unique:
        unique_jokes.add(jokes[i])

# Count unique jokes
num_unique_jokes = len(unique_jokes)
num_unique_jokes


All 5 jokes are unique! None of them are too similar to each other. ðŸŽ‰`
