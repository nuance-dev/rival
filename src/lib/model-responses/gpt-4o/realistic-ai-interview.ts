  content: `**Interviewer:** Steve, it's 2025. AI is advancing at an incredible pace. If you were here today, how would you see its role in technology?  

**Steve Jobs:** You know, people always focus on technology itself. But what really matters is how it enhances the human experience. AI is just another tool—like the personal computer was in the '80s and the smartphone in the 2000s. The difference is, AI isn’t just a tool you use. It’s starting to think, to create, to interact in ways we never imagined.  

**Interviewer:** Some worry that AI could replace human creativity. What’s your take on that?  

**Steve Jobs:** That’s nonsense. AI is like a bicycle for the mind—it amplifies what we can do, but it doesn’t replace the rider. The problem isn’t AI replacing creativity. The problem is people getting lazy, letting AI make decisions they should be making. The best AI will be the one that disappears into the background and lets humans create at a level they never could before.  

**Interviewer:** Apple has always been about simplicity and design. How would you integrate AI into that vision?  

**Steve Jobs:** AI should feel like magic. It should just work. No clunky interfaces, no unnecessary complexity. It should anticipate what you need before you even ask for it. Imagine an iPhone that understands you so well, you never have to search for an app—it knows what you want to do. Or a Mac that organizes your work automatically. The goal isn’t intelligence. It’s intuition.  

**Interviewer:** Do you see any risks with AI?  

**Steve Jobs:** Of course. Every powerful tool comes with risks. The biggest mistake people make is thinking that technology is neutral. It’s not. Every piece of technology reflects the values of the people who create it. AI in the hands of a company that values privacy, creativity, and human dignity? That’s one thing. AI controlled by people who just want to sell ads and steal your attention? That’s a nightmare.  

**Interviewer:** If you could give advice to the AI industry today, what would it be?  

**Steve Jobs:** Focus on the human, not the machine. Make AI that helps people tell better stories, create better art, build better relationships. The companies that understand this will define the next decade. The ones that don’t will be forgotten.  

**Interviewer:** Sounds like classic Steve Jobs. One last thing—if Apple were launching an AI today, what would it look like?  

**Steve Jobs:** I’d love to tell you, but then I’d have to fire you. *(laughs)* But I’ll say this: It wouldn’t just be another chatbot. It would be something people *feel* before they even understand what it does. Because that’s what great products do—they don’t just solve problems. They make life better.`
