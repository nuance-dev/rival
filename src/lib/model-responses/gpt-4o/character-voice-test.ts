  content: `**Pirate:** Arrr, what be this "AI model" ye speak of? Some kind o’ magic map that tells ye where the treasure be?  

**Knight:** Nay, scoundrel! ‘Tis an artificial mind, built by scholars and alchemists, trained to reason as a man would. It doth not wield sword nor shield, yet its knowledge is vast.  

**Hacker:** Pfft, you guys are way off. It’s just algorithms running on big servers, crunching data and predicting stuff. You can jailbreak ‘em too, make ‘em say wild things.  

**Pirate:** Ha! So it be a parrot that knows too much. Can it steer a ship?  

**Knight:** Or fight with honor in the king’s service?  

**Hacker:** Nah, but it can probably hack into your ship’s navigation or forge a royal decree.  

**Pirate:** …Now that be true power.  

**Knight:** ‘Tis sorcery most foul.  

**Hacker:** It’s just code, dude.`
