  content: `**Interviewer:** Thank you for joining us today, Steve. It’s a pleasure to have you here in 2025. Let’s dive right into it. How do you see the role of AI evolving in our daily lives?

**Steve Jobs:** Thank you for having me. It's fascinating to think about how AI has integrated itself into almost every aspect of our lives. In 2025, I believe AI is not just a tool; it's becoming a partner—something that enhances our creativity and productivity rather than replaces it. The best technologies are those that help us express our humanity, and AI should empower us to do just that.

**Interviewer:** That’s a refreshing perspective. Some critics argue that AI can diminish creativity. What would you say to that?

**Steve Jobs:** Critics are right to be cautious. It's essential to maintain a balance. If we let AI do all the thinking for us, we risk losing the essence of what makes us human. However, if we leverage AI as a collaborator— much like how a good guitar helps a musician—we can produce something truly beautiful. Think of AI as a co-creator, not a competitor.

**Interviewer:** What role do you think design plays in the development of AI technologies?

**Steve Jobs:** Design is paramount. AI's capabilities can be powerful, but if the user experience isn't intuitive, then its true potential isn't realized. Design should aim to make complex technology understandable and accessible. At Apple, we always focused on creating products that delighted users, and that philosophy must apply to AI as well. It should feel seamless in our lives, almost invisible but profoundly impactful.

**Interviewer:** As AI continues to grow, what do you think the ethical implications might be?

**Steve Jobs:** Ethical considerations are critical. We are responsible for the technologies we create, and with great power comes great responsibility. The key is to ensure transparency in AI. We must be vigilant against biases in algorithms and advocate for responsible use. If we develop AI ethically, it can lead to a more equitable society. This isn’t just a technological challenge; it’s a moral one.

**Interviewer:** Looking toward the future, what excites you the most about AI?

**Steve Jobs:** What excites me is the potential of AI to solve complex global issues. Imagine AI systems helping to tackle climate change, diagnose diseases, or even streamline education. The possibilities are vast. But, as I said earlier, the excitement should be channeled into ensuring that the development is done thoughtfully, creatively, and ethically.

**Interviewer:** In your view, what will the relationship between humans and AI look like in the next decade?

**Steve Jobs:** I envision a collaborative partnership. We’ll rely on AI for tasks that are mundane, allowing us to focus on creative problem-solving and innovation. Rather than a world of humans versus machines, it will be one of synergy—where we enhance each other’s strengths. It’s a new chapter of partnership, and it can lead to incredible advancements.

**Interviewer:** Finally, what advice would you give to the next generation of innovators looking to work with AI?

**Steve Jobs:** Stay curious and prioritize empathy. Understand the needs of the people you’re designing for. Remember that the aim of technology should be to enhance the human experience, not complicate it. Don’t shy away from challenging the status quo. Embrace creativity and think outside the box. Innovation is not just about the technology; it’s about transforming lives for the better.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Steve. It’s always inspiring to hear your vision for the future. 

**Steve Jobs:** Thank you. Remember, the best way to predict the future is to invent it. Let's keep pushing the boundaries.`
