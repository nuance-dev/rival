### Step 1: Understand the Model Size

GPT-3 is a transformer model with 175 billion parameters. This is a significant number of parameters, which will impact the total computation.

### Step 2: Consider the Training Process

Training a model like GPT-3 involves several steps for each training iteration:
1.  **Forward Pass**
2.  **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**
3.  **Weight Update**

Each of these steps requires a certain number of FLOPs.

### Step 3: FLOPs Calculation for the Forward and Backward Pass

For transformer models like GPT-3, the following can be estimated:

-   **Forward Pass:** The forward pass through the model consists of several matrix multiplications and other operations. A rough estimate is that the forward pass requires approximately \\( 2 \\times \\text{number of parameters} \\) in terms of FLOPs due to matrix multiplications being computed for each token in the input sequence.

-   **Backward Pass:** The backward pass generally requires about the same amount of computational resources as the forward pass, though not exactly the same. A common rule of thumb is that it could also require around \\( 2 \\times \\text{number of parameters} \\).

### Step 4: Total FLOPs for One Training Step

Combining the two, for one forward and backward pass, we can estimate:

\\[
\\text{Total FLOPs per training step} \\approx 4 \\times \\text{number of parameters}
\\]

With \\( 175 \\) billion parameters:

\\[
\\text{Total FLOPs per training step} \\approx 4 \\times 175 \\times 10^9 \\approx 700 \\times 10^9 = 700 \\text{ billion FLOPs}
\\]

### Step 5: Number of Training Steps

Next, we need to estimate the total number of training steps (batches) required. GPT-3 was trained on a mixture of datasets, with a significant amount of text (hundreds of gigabytes). A rough estimate for the effective number of training iterations could be in the order of hundreds of thousands to millions. Let's assume around \\( 300,000 \\) training steps (which is a reasonable estimate based on the scale of large language model training).

### Step 6: Total FLOPs for Training

Now we can calculate the total FLOPs for training:

\\[
\\text{Total FLOPs} \\approx (\\text{Total FLOPs per training step}) \\times (\\text{number of training steps})
\\]

Substituting the values we have:

\\[
\\text{Total FLOPs} \\approx 700 \\times 10^9 \\times 300,000 \\approx 210 \\times 10^{15} = 210 \\text{ petaFLOPs}
\\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the estimated total number of FLOPs required to train GPT-3 is approximately **210 petaFLOPs**. This number is an approximation and actual values can vary based on specific architectures, optimizations, and hardware used during training.`
