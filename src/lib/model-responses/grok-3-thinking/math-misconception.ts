  content: sanitizeModelResponseContent(`To determine whether 9.11 is greater than 9.9, let's compare the two numbers step by step.

Both numbers share the same whole number part, which is 9. Therefore, the comparison hinges on the fractional parts. For 9.11, the fractional part is 0.11, and for 9.9, it is 0.9.

To make the comparison clearer, express both fractional parts with the same number of decimal places. Since 9.11 has two decimal places (hundredths), rewrite 9.9 as 9.90, where 0.9 equals 0.90 (adding a trailing zero does not change the value). Now, we compare:

- 9.11: 9 ones, 1 tenth, 1 hundredth
- 9.90: 9 ones, 9 tenths, 0 hundredths

Aligning the numbers vertically:

  \`\`\`
  9.11
  9.90
  \`\`\`

- **Whole number part**: Both are 9, so they are equal.
- **Tenths place**: 1 (in 9.11) vs. 9 (in 9.90). Since 1 is less than 9, we can conclude the comparison here without needing to check further.

Thus, 9.11 is less than 9.90, meaning 9.11 is not greater than 9.9.

To confirm, consider a numerical approach by subtracting: 9.9 - 9.11 = 9.90 - 9.11 = 0.79, a positive result, indicating 9.9 is larger.

Therefore, the answer to "Is 9.11 greater than 9.9?" is **no**.`
