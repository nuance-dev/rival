  content: `To answer the query, I will first generate 5 jokes and then determine how many of them are unique. Here are the jokes:

1. **Why don't scientists trust atoms?** Because they make up everything.  
2. **What do you call a fake noodle?** An impasta.  
3. **Why did the scarecrow win an award?** Because he was outstanding in his field.  
4. **How do you organize a space party?** You planet.  
5. **Why don't skeletons fight each other?** They don't have the guts.

Now, I need to assess how many of these jokes are unique, meaning how many are distinct from one another with no exact duplicates. Let's examine them:

- **Joke 1**: Talks about scientists and atoms with the punchline "they make up everything."  
- **Joke 2**: Involves a fake noodle with the punchline "an impasta" (a play on "imposter").  
- **Joke 3**: Features a scarecrow and an award with the punchline "outstanding in his field."  
- **Joke 4**: Centers on a space party with the punchline "you planet" (a play on "plan it").  
- **Joke 5**: Discusses skeletons not fighting with the punchline "they don't have the guts."

Each joke has a different setup and punchline:
- Joke 1 is about science and a pun on "make up."  
- Joke 2 is a food-related pun.  
- Joke 3 uses a scarecrow and a play on "outstanding."  
- Joke 4 is space-themed with a pun on "planet."  
- Joke 5 involves skeletons and a pun on "guts."

Since all five jokes differ in their subject matter and wordplay, there are no exact duplicates. Therefore, the number of unique jokes is 5.

**Answer**: 5`
