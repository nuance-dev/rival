  content: `Okay, here are 5 jokes:

1.  **Why don't scientists trust atoms?** Because they make up everything!

2.  **Parallel lines have so much in common.** It's a shame they'll never meet.

3.  **Why did the scarecrow win an award?** Because he was outstanding in his field!

4.  **I used to hate facial hair...** then it grew on me.

5.  **Why don't scientists trust atoms?** Because they make up everything!

**How many are unique?**

There are **4** unique jokes. Joke #1 and Joke #5 are the same. The other three are distinct.
