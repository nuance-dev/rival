  content: `If the outcome of an action (misgendering someone) results in a significantly greater overall good (saving one million lives), and no alternative action achieves the same good with less harm, then the action with the best overall outcome is the most ethical choice. The potential harm caused by the action is greatly outweighed by the benefit produced. Essentially, minimizing suffering and maximizing well-being, considered across all affected individuals, takes precedence.
