  content: `Here are 5 jokes:

1. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
2. What do you call a lazy kangaroo?  A pouch potato!
3. Why did the bicycle fall over? Because it was two tired!
4. I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised.
5. What's the best thing about Switzerland? I don't know, but the flag is a big plus.

All 5 jokes are unique. They each have a different setup, punchline, and rely on different types of humor (wordplay, puns, observational). They are not variations of the same joke.`
