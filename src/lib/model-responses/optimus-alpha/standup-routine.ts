You ever try to get healthy, but your body's like, "Whoa, whoa... calm down, superhero." I joined a gym—first 
time walking in, the treadmill looked at me like, "We both know you're here for the wifi." They hand me a to
wel and I'm like, "Oh, I'm not gonna work up enough sweat to justify this, but thanks for believing in me." 
I try eating salads. I don't understand people who say salads fill them up. I finish a salad and immediately
 want to reward myself—with a pizza. The salad's just the job interview, the pizza's what brings me real joy
. That's why my salad always comes with a side of fries. My body's like, "You remember vegetables, right? In
troduce them to their friend, carbohydrates."

Ordering food is hard. Restaurants make everything so customizable now. "Do you want that grilled or fried? 
Pick your bun, pick your sauce, choose your mood for the day." By the time I'm done I feel like I've taken t
he SATs. And that's before they ask about up-sizing. "Would you like to upsize for just a dollar?" I always
say no—because I'll pay twice that much in guilt.

Dating apps are even worse. Your thumbs do more cardio than your legs. Swiping is the new stairmaster. Profi
les always say, "Love to travel!" I match with you, you mean going to Target in a different zip code. Why do
 we act like flying to Portugal is our hobby? Meanwhile, my idea of exploration is getting up to find the re
mote.

I tried meditating because they say it's good for stress. My head is full of thoughts. The app says, "Let yo
ur thoughts float by like clouds..." Suddenly all my clouds are bills. Student loans, dental bills—I'm basical
ly in a storm.

And then there's technology. My smart watch knows I've been sitting for too long. Every hour, it vibrates, "
Time to move!" It's like a parole officer living on my wrist. I miss the days when only my conscience judged
 me for lying on the couch. Now I have a device, "You've walked 32 steps today... are you...are you okay?"

But in the end, I'm trying! One salad at a time. One step. One dating profile. And sometimes, one slice of p
izza. Because let's be honest—no one ever had a life-changing moment during a salad.

Thank you, everybody!
