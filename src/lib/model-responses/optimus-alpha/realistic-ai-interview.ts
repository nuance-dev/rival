  content: `**Interviewer:** Steve, it's surreal and inspiring to imagine talking to you in 2025. The world is buzzing about AI. How do you see AI impacting society?

**Steve Jobs:** Thank you. You know, when we built the Mac, our goal was to put power in people's hands. With AI, we're at a similar inflection point—but it's a hundred times bigger. The real promise of AI isn't replacing people. It's amplifying them. The best technology is a bicycle for the mind, and AI could be a rocketship.

**Interviewer:** That's a compelling analogy. Where do you see the biggest positive impacts?

**Steve Jobs:** Creativity and learning, absolutely. Imagine a kid with a personalized tutor that understands exactly how they learn. Or an artist collaborating with AI to paint ideas they never dreamed of. If we get this right, we take down a lot of barriers. People can create, connect, and solve problems in ways we can't even imagine.

**Interviewer:** There are also fears—about jobs, privacy, control. How do you think society should approach these concerns?

**Steve Jobs:** Fear is natural with big changes. But we don't make progress by hiding under the bed. The key is to keep humans at the center. Technology for its own sake is worthless. It's about what it lets people do. That means designing AI that's transparent, respects privacy, and gives users control. And, frankly, we need leaders—tech and government—who grok both the potential and the responsibility.

**Interviewer:** Some worry AI could make machines more human, but also make humans more machine-like. Do you see a danger there?

**Steve Jobs:** Absolutely. The danger is thinking efficiency is the highest goal. Life's not about being more like a cog. It's about enriching the human experience. So, yes, we should use AI to eliminate drudgery, but let's make sure we keep the humanity in what we do. That takes intention in design—creating tools that inspire, not just automate.

**Interviewer:** If you were launching a startup today, what would you build in the AI space?

**Steve Jobs:** (laughs) I wouldn't say exactly, but I'd focus on making AI invisible—so it fades into the background, letting people focus on what matters to them. Maybe something that helps people find meaning in their work, or express themselves, or connect with others more deeply. Beautiful, intuitive, human-centered—that's where the magic happens.

**Interviewer:** Last question—what advice would you give young creators entering this AI era?

**Steve Jobs:** Stay curious. Don't settle. Don't let the tools lead you; lead the tools. And remember—technology alone isn't enough. It's technology married with the liberal arts, with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing.`
