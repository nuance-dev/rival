**Interviewer:**  
Steve, it's astonishing to see you back with us in 2025—even if in this new, holographic form. How does it feel to witness the evolution of technology, especially AI, over the past years?

**Steve Jobs:**  
It’s surreal, isn’t it? I always believed that technology is an extension of our imagination. Seeing AI mature into something that seamlessly integrates into our lives feels like watching a dream evolve into reality. It’s not just about smarter machines—it’s about tools that empower human creativity.

**Interviewer:**  
In your time, you revolutionized personal computing. Now, AI is everywhere—from our phones to our homes. What excites you most about AI's current role?

**Steve Jobs:**  
What excites me is its potential to transform how we interact with the world. AI should be invisible, yet incredibly powerful—a partner that anticipates our needs. It’s not about replacing the human touch but enhancing it. Imagine AI that learns your habits, understands your moods, and helps you create in ways you never thought possible. That is where technology meets art.

**Interviewer:**  
Apple has always emphasized the convergence of technology and liberal arts. How should companies approach AI innovation to ensure it remains human-centric?

**Steve Jobs:**  
Innovation isn’t merely about having the most advanced technology—it’s about making technology that feels natural and personal. Companies must design AI with simplicity and elegance at its core. It should amplify our creativity rather than overshadow it. The goal is to create experiences where technology fades into the background, leaving you with nothing but a deeper connection to your work and life.

**Interviewer:**  
There’s a growing conversation about the ethical implications of AI. What are your thoughts on balancing innovation with responsibility?

**Steve Jobs:**  
Every breakthrough comes with responsibility. With AI, we’re at a crossroads where ethical design is paramount. We need to ensure that AI is transparent, respects privacy, and upholds fairness. Just as design was a critical element at Apple, the ethical framework of AI must be thoughtfully crafted. The technology should serve us, not dictate our choices, and that starts with the values embedded in its creation.

**Interviewer:**  
Looking ahead, what do you envision as the next big leap in AI technology?

**Steve Jobs:**  
I see a future where AI becomes a true collaborator—a creative partner that understands and adapts to the nuances of each individual. Picture a world where your AI isn’t just a tool but a trusted assistant, anticipating your needs in real time, whether you’re designing, composing music, or even exploring new ideas in science. It’s about blending human intuition with machine precision to craft experiences that are both beautiful and meaningful.

**Interviewer:**  
Finally, what message would you give to innovators and dreamers who are pushing the boundaries of AI today?

**Steve Jobs:**  
Stay hungry, stay foolish. Always remember that technology is ultimately about people. Don’t be afraid to dream big, to challenge the status quo, and to infuse your work with passion and purpose. The future of AI isn’t written by algorithms alone—it’s written by every human who dares to imagine a better world.
