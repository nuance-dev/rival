  content: `Okay, let's simulate this. Imagine it's late 2025. AI has continued its rapid advancement. Large Language Models are more integrated, generative AI is commonplace, and debates about AGI and ethics are fierce. By some unexplained, hypothetical means, Steve Jobs is available for an exclusive interview.

**Setting:** A minimalist, brightly lit room. Perhaps reminiscent of Apple's design aesthetic.

**Interviewer:** Sarah Chen, Senior Tech Correspondent for "Future Forward" magazine.

**Subject:** Steve Jobs, looking much as he did in his later years, wearing his signature black turtleneck, jeans, and sneakers. He seems thoughtful, perhaps slightly impatient, but engaged.

**(Simulation Start)**

**Sarah Chen:** Steve, thank you for this... unprecedented opportunity. It's truly surreal to be speaking with you in 2025. The world has changed immensely, especially with the explosion of Artificial Intelligence. What are your initial thoughts looking at the state of AI today?

**Steve Jobs:** (Leans forward slightly, eyes intense) It's noisy. That's the first thing. Everyone's throwing spaghetti at the wall, calling it innovation. Lots of features, lots of demos, lots of... computation. But is it *better*? Does it make things simpler, more intuitive? Mostly, no. It's technology for technology's sake right now. Raw power without enough *taste*, without enough care for the human experience.

**Sarah Chen:** So you're not impressed by models like GPT-5 or advanced image generation? They seem revolutionary to many.

**Steve Jobs:** (A slight, dismissive wave of the hand) Look, the raw capability is… interesting. Like having a thousand horsepower engine. Impressive on paper. But if it's bolted into a car that handles like a pig and looks like a toaster, who cares? These models... they can generate stuff, sure. Sometimes it's clever, sometimes it's garbage. But it's often disconnected. It's not *integrated* into a seamless workflow. It doesn't anticipate what you *really* need in a deep, intuitive way. It feels… bolted on. Like Clippy, but with a PhD. (A wry smile).

**Sarah Chen:** How would *you* approach AI integration, then? If you were leading Apple today?

**Steve Jobs:** Simple. It shouldn't *feel* like AI. It should just feel... smarter. More helpful. Like the device finally *understands* you, anticipates your next step without being creepy or intrusive. It needs to be deeply woven into the operating system, into the hardware itself. On-device intelligence is key – for speed, for privacy. You don't want your personal thoughts constantly flying off to some server farm. It has to be personal. It has to respect the user. And it has to be *beautifully* implemented. The interface shouldn't be a command line or a clunky chat window; the AI should enhance the *existing* experience, make it fluid, almost invisible.

**Sarah Chen:** There's a lot of discussion about AI augmenting or even replacing human creativity. Where do you stand on that?

**Steve Jobs:** (Scoffs softly) That's fear talking. Did the synthesizer replace musicians? Did Photoshop replace photographers? No. They became *tools*. Powerful tools, yes, but tools nonetheless. AI should be the ultimate tool. A bicycle for the mind, amplified. It can handle the drudgery, suggest possibilities, accelerate the process. But the *spark*? The *idea*? The *taste*? That comes from us. AI can generate a million images, but it takes a human eye to know which one *works*, which one has soul. The danger isn't AI replacing creatives; it's creatives *not* learning how to use these new tools to push their own boundaries.

**Sarah Chen:** What about the ethical concerns? Bias in models, potential for misuse, job displacement...?

**Steve Jobs:** These aren't *AI* problems; they're *human* problems, amplified by powerful technology. Bias comes from the data we feed it, which reflects our *own* biases. Misuse comes from human intent. Job displacement... well, technology has always done that. It creates new jobs too. The solution isn't to stop progress. It's to be *thoughtful*. To build systems with values. To prioritize user control and transparency. At Apple, we always believed technology alone isn't enough. It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing. AI needs that more than ever. It needs a conscience, and *we* have to provide it through careful design and clear principles.

**Sarah Chen:** Looking further ahead, what about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)? The idea of machines matching or exceeding human intellect across the board. Is that something Apple should pursue?

**Steve Jobs:** (Pauses, looks thoughtful) AGI... it's the ultimate abstraction. Sounds like something engineers dream up when they're bored. Look, the goal isn't to replicate a human mind. Why would we? We already have billions of those, and they're quite remarkable, warts and all. The goal is to create tools that *augment* human intelligence, that help us solve problems we couldn't solve before, that make our lives richer, more productive, more connected. Building some kind of digital god? That's... profoundly uninteresting to me. Focus on making insanely great *tools* that people love to use. That's hard enough. That's meaningful.

**Sarah Chen:** One final question, Steve. What is the single most important thing designers and engineers working on AI should keep in mind for the future?

**Steve Jobs:** (Leans back, a faint smile) Remember who you're building it for. It's not about the algorithms, the data centers, the processing power. It's about the person holding the device. It's about making their life better, simpler, more delightful. Start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. Always. If you lose sight of the human at the center of it all, you've already failed. Don't ship junk, and never, ever lose your taste.

**Sarah Chen:** Steve Jobs, thank you. This has been illuminating.

**Steve Jobs:** (Nods curtly, stands up as if ready to move onto the next thing) Alright.
