  content: `No, 9.11 is **not** greater than 9.9.

Here's how to compare them:

1.  **Look at the whole number part:** Both numbers have 9 before the decimal point, so they are equal so far.
2.  **Look at the tenths place (the first digit after the decimal):**
    *   9.11 has a **1** in the tenths place.
    *   9.9 has a **9** in the tenths place.
3.  **Compare those digits:** Since 1 is less than 9, the number 9.11 is **less than** 9.9.

Therefore, 9.9 is greater than 9.11.`
