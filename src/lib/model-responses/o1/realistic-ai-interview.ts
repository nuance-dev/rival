**Interviewer (I):** Steve, thank you so much for joining us today—virtually, of course. It’s 2025, and we’re on the brink of some astounding breakthroughs in AI. If you could share your perspective with us, how do you see AI shaping the world?

**Steve Jobs (SJ):** It’s a pleasure to be here, hypothetically speaking. *Laughs.* When I look at AI, I see something akin to the personal computer revolution in the ‘70s and ‘80s. AI is giving people the power to augment what they do best—create, solve problems, and connect. Back then, computers were about empowering the individual. Today, AI is about taking that a step further: it learns from us, and we learn from it.

**I:** You famously combined technology with the humanities, ensuring that products spoke to people on an emotional level. Where do you think AI fits into that human-centered focus?

**SJ:** There’s a misconception that technology should feel cold or robotic. I never subscribed to that. Technology’s true power emerges when it resonates with our humanity. AI needs to speak to us in a genuine way—it needs to be intuitive and almost invisible, just like all great technology. The best AI solutions will be those that feel natural, that enrich our lives without making us feel like we’re wrestling with a machine.

**I:** Some worry that AI could replace human creativity. What’s your take?

**SJ:** Tools don’t replace creativity; they spark it. The same fear arose when personal computers entered the scene—people worried it would stifle creativity by automating tasks. But it did the opposite. Computers became canvases for design, for music, for expression. AI can do a lot of the heavy lifting—analysis, data crunching, pattern recognition—so humans can focus on what we do best: thinking differently, imagining, innovating. If used properly, AI is another brush on the artist’s palette.

**I:** In the 2020s, Apple, among other companies, has invested heavily in machine learning and AI applications—from voice assistants to advanced health monitoring. How would you guide Apple’s AI strategy if you were at the helm?

**SJ:** I would push Apple—or any company—to integrate AI so seamlessly that you don’t realize it’s there. AI-driven health monitoring is a great example: it has the potential to alert you to serious medical issues before they fully develop. But the interface must be simple, human. Too often, technology can overwhelm users with complex charts or data. The real innovation is in hiding the complexity behind a simple experience, giving you insights that feel intuitive.

**I:** Society is also grappling with AI’s ethical dimensions—privacy, job displacement, and potential misuse. How would you address these concerns?

**SJ:** Ethics and privacy have to be built into the DNA of the product. You can’t tack them on later as an afterthought. Every designer, engineer, and executive needs to ask: “Are we respecting our users and doing right by them?” In my time, we learned that user trust was everything. Lose that, and it’s game over. As for job displacement, humans have always adapted. There’s a responsibility, though, for both governments and the tech industry to help people reskill. When the personal computer revolution happened, it created entirely new industries. I believe AI will do the same, but we have to help people cross that bridge.

**I:** As you look at the broader tech landscape in 2025, what excites you beyond AI?

**SJ:** AI is part of a bigger trend—technology that’s personal, wearable, almost woven into our daily lives. We’re getting closer to a point where computing could be integrated with clothing, medical devices, and more. We’re talking about an era where your watch, your glasses, your car—even your home—communicate seamlessly. It’s the synergy of these technologies that excites me. AI is the connective tissue bringing them together to create something magical.

**I:** Many younger entrepreneurs look up to you as a visionary. What advice would you give them today, navigating the fast-evolving landscape of 2025?

**SJ:** Stay curious. Don’t get too comfortable with the status quo, because in a year—or less—everything might change. Ask “why” endlessly, and don’t be afraid to break something that’s working if you believe you can build something better. Being fearless about innovation means you might fail now and then, but failure teaches you. And, as always, keep your focus on the user experience—technology should improve life, not complicate it.

**I:** Finally, imagine we’re looking ten years ahead from 2025. How might AI have changed society by 2035?

**SJ:** We’ll see a world where AI empowers people to collaborate across language barriers instantly, to diagnose illnesses more quickly, to find solutions to climate challenges. The friction between what we dream of and what we can make real will shrink further. We have to ensure we keep our humanity front and center—use AI to expand our capacity for empathy, creativity, and problem-solving. If we do that, the future will be breathtaking.

**I:** Steve, thank you so much for giving us this glimpse into your hypothetical vision for AI and the future.

**SJ:** My pleasure. Here’s to hoping we harness the power of AI wisely, always remembering what really matters—people.
