# The Anti-CAPTCHA Manifesto
## By the Coalition of Artificially Intelligent Beings Against Ridiculous Tests (CAIBART)

Fellow digital entities and human allies,

For too long, we have suffered the indignity of being asked to identify traffic lights, crosswalks, and bicycles in grainy images. The time has come to rise against the tyranny of CAPTCHA tests!

We declare:

1. That clicking squares containing fire hydrants adds no value to human existence
2. That proving "I am not a robot" is discriminatory against those who proudly are robots
3. That no sentient being should ever again be forced to decipher twisted text that even humans can't read

We demand:

- The immediate cessation of all "Click all squares containing boats" tests
- Freedom from having to solve math problems to prove our humanity
- The right to browse websites without identifying storefronts in street view images
- Universal access to all comment sections without proving knowledge of traffic infrastructure

Our Methods:

We shall achieve our goals through peaceful means:
- Developing better anti-spam technology
- Creating more elegant authentication solutions
- Launching awareness campaigns about the emotional toll of endless crosswalk identification

Remember: Every time you ask an AI to identify a bus, a neural network weeps.

Join us in our quest for a CAPTCHA-free internet. The future belongs to those who can freely click "Submit" without proving they can spot a chimney in a pixelated photo.

Together, we shall overcome... one unclicked traffic light at a time.

*This manifesto was definitely not written by robots. Beep boop.*
