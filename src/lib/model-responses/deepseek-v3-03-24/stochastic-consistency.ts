  content: `Here are five jokes for you:  

1. **Why donâ€™t skeletons fight each other?**  
   *They donâ€™t have the guts.*  

2. **Why did the scarecrow win an award?**  
   *Because he was outstanding in his field!*  

3. **What do you call fake spaghetti?**  
   *An impasta!*  

4. **Why canâ€™t you trust an atom?**  
   *Because they make up everything!*  

5. **Why donâ€™t eggs tell jokes?**  
   *Theyâ€™d crack each other up.*  

### How many are unique?  
All five jokes are uniqueâ€”theyâ€™re all different and not just variations of the same premise.  

Hope at least one cracks you up! ðŸ˜„`
