  content: `**3-Minute Stand-Up Comedy Routine (No Puns Allowed)**  

**Opening:**  
(Adjust mic) You ever notice how everyone lies about their height on dating apps? “I’m 6 feet tall.” *Really?* Because I’m 5’11”, and you’re *definitely* shorter than me. You’re out here claiming 6 feet like it’s a tax deduction. “Yeah, I donated to charity… my height.”  

**Dating:**  
Dating apps are wild. You’re swiping through people like, “Oh, you like hiking? *Wow.* You and every other basic human who owns a pair of sneakers.” Meanwhile, their bio says, “I love to laugh!” Cool, so you’ve experienced joy—*groundbreaking.*  

And first dates? Awkward. You’re both pretending you don’t have Google. “So… what do you do?” *I already stalked your LinkedIn, Jessica. I know you’re in “strategic marketing synergy.”*  

**Gym Life:**  
I joined a gym recently. Big mistake. Everyone there looks like they’re training for the *Avengers*, and I’m just trying not to die on the treadmill. The other day, some guy grunted so loud, I thought he was either lifting 300 pounds or *giving birth.*  

And gym etiquette? If you take a machine and then just sit there scrolling Instagram, you’re a *menace.* You’re not working out; you’re just *holding equipment hostage.*  

**Social Media:**  
Social media is just people pretending their life is perfect. “Look at my avocado toast!” Wow, you put an egg on bread—*call the Louvre.* Meanwhile, I’m over here eating cereal for dinner like, “This is fine. *This is fine.”*  

And don’t get me started on LinkedIn. Everyone’s a “thought leader” or a “disruptor.” *Really?* Because your last post was just a screenshot of a quote you copied from Google.  

**Closing:**  
Life’s weird, man. We’re all out here pretending we know what we’re doing. But deep down? We’re all just Googling “how to adult” at 2 a.m.  

(Beat)  
Anyway, I’m out of time. You’ve been great—or at least, you *laughed politely.* That’s all I can ask for. Goodnight!  

*(Drop mic—or gently place it down if you’re not confident in your mic-drop skills.)*  

---  
This routine keeps it light, relatable, and punchy without relying on puns. Hope it lands! Let me know if you'd like any tweaks.`
