*Setting: A sleek, minimalist studio. Steve Jobs, dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and jeans, sits across from the interviewer, exuding his characteristic calm intensity.*

**Interviewer:** Steve, it’s an honor to have you here. Let’s talk about AI—2025 has been a landmark year. What’s your take on where we are?  

**Steve Jobs:** *[smirking]* You know, people keep saying AI is revolutionary—and it is—but revolution is messy. Right now, we’re in the "clunky prototype" phase. Siri was a whisper; today’s AI is a shout. But it’s still shouting gibberish half the time.  

**Interviewer:** So you’re not impressed?  

**Jobs:** *[leans forward]* No, no—I’m *fascinated*. But impressed? That comes when it’s seamless. When it’s not just a tool but an extension of human intent. Think of the first Mac—it wasn’t about specs. It was about *feeling* like you were holding the future. AI hasn’t gotten there yet.  

**Interviewer:** Critics say AI is replacing creativity—art, music, even coding. Threat or opportunity?  

**Jobs:** *[waves hand dismissively]* People said calculators would kill math. Tools don’t replace creativity; they amplify it. The real danger isn’t AI taking jobs—it’s *mediocre* AI making people lazy. We need AI that pushes us to think *differently*, not just faster.  

**Interviewer:** Apple’s been quiet about generative AI compared to Google or OpenAI. Why?  

**Jobs:** *[grins]* Apple doesn’t race to be first. We race to be *right*. Remember the iPhone? MP3 players and phones existed. We made them *sing together*. AI needs that harmony—privacy, simplicity, magic. Right now, most of it feels like a science project.  

**Interviewer:** What’s the "iPhone moment" for AI, then?  

**Jobs:** *[pauses]* When you stop talking about "AI" at all. It’s like electricity—you don’t think "electricity" when you turn on a light. The breakthrough? AI that *disappears*. It knows what you need before you ask, but it doesn’t *feel* like some chatty robot. It’s just… there.  

**Interviewer:** Final thought—what scares you?  

**Jobs:** *[softly]* The same thing that always has—people settling. AI could be a bicycle for the mind, like I said decades ago. Or it could be a crutch. The difference? *Taste.* We need builders who care about beauty, humanity—not just speed.  

**Interviewer:** Steve Jobs, thank you.  

**Jobs:** *[nods]* Keep pushing.
