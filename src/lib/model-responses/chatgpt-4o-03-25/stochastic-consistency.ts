  content: `Here are 5 jokes:

1. Why don’t skeletons fight each other?  
   Because they don’t have the guts.

2. I told my computer I needed a break…  
   Now it won’t stop sending me vacation ads.

3. Parallel lines have so much in common.  
   It’s a shame they’ll never meet.

4. What do you call a fish wearing a bowtie?  
   Sofishticated.

5. I asked the librarian if the library had books on paranoia.  
   She whispered, "They're right behind you..."

All 5 jokes are **unique** — none of them repeat or share the same punchline.`
