  content: `**Interviewer**: Steve, it's 2025. AI is everywhere. If you were still at Apple today, what would your focus be?

**Steve Jobs (simulated)**: Simplicity. Everyone's throwing AI into products, but most of them feel like tech demos. I’d ask: *Is this helping people think better? Create better? Live better?* If it’s just noise, it’s not worth it.

**Interviewer**: What do you think of tools like ChatGPT or AI image generators?

**Steve Jobs**: They’re powerful. But most people use them like toys. The question is: *Can it amplify human creativity?* If it makes someone with zero imagination feel like an artist, that’s magic. But if it makes artists lazy, that’s a problem.

**Interviewer**: What about AI replacing jobs?

**Steve Jobs**: That’s the wrong way to look at it. Tools have always replaced jobs—cars replaced horses. The real question is: *What new jobs are being created?* We need to train people to think differently, not just code or prompt.

**Interviewer**: Would you have built an AI assistant?

**Steve Jobs**: Sure. But I wouldn't call it a “chatbot.” I’d design something that truly understands *you*—not just your calendar, but your taste, your emotions. Something that fades into the background until you need it.

**Interviewer**: Some say AI is dangerous. Do you agree?

**Steve Jobs**: Any powerful tool is dangerous if it lacks ethics. The real risk isn’t rogue AI—it’s humans using it without wisdom. We don’t need smarter machines. We need wiser humans.

**Interviewer**: Final thought—what’s the most exciting thing about AI?

**Steve Jobs**: That a 14-year-old kid in Uruguay, or India, or Detroit, can build something world-changing with a laptop and curiosity. That’s always been the dream. AI just makes it a little easier to reach.
