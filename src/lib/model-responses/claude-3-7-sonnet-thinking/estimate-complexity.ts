I'll estimate the total number of floating point operations (FLOPs) required to train GPT-3 by breaking down the calculation step by step.

## Model Architecture Facts
- GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters
- Uses a transformer architecture with multiple layers
- Context length of 2048 tokens
- Trained on approximately 300 billion tokens

## Calculating FLOPs per Token

For transformer models, we need to account for operations in:
1. Self-attention mechanisms
2. Feed-forward networks
3. Layer normalization and other operations

For GPT-3, let's use these parameters:
- Embedding dimension (d): ~12,288
- Number of layers (L): ~96
- Context length (s): 2,048

### Forward Pass Calculation
For each token in each layer:
- Self-attention: ~4 × d² + 2 × d × s FLOPs
- Feed-forward network: ~8 × d² FLOPs
- Other operations: ~d FLOPs

Total FLOPs per token (forward pass):
≈ L × (12 × d² + 2 × d × s)
≈ 96 × (12 × 12,288² + 2 × 12,288 × 2,048)
≈ 96 × (1.8 × 10⁹ + 5 × 10⁷)
≈ 1.8 × 10¹¹ FLOPs

### Backward Pass
The backward pass typically requires about 2× the computation of the forward pass:
≈ 2 × 1.8 × 10¹¹ ≈ 3.6 × 10¹¹ FLOPs

Total FLOPs per token (forward + backward):
≈ 1.8 × 10¹¹ + 3.6 × 10¹¹ ≈ 5.4 × 10¹¹ FLOPs

## Total Training FLOPs
Multiply by the total number of tokens processed:
≈ 5.4 × 10¹¹ × 300 × 10⁹
≈ 1.62 × 10²³ FLOPs

## Alternative Calculation
As a sanity check, using a simpler heuristic:
- Each parameter requires ~2-4 FLOPs per token (including forward, backward, and weight update)
- 175B parameters × 4 FLOPs × 300B tokens
≈ 2.1 × 10²³ FLOPs

## Conclusion
The total training computation for GPT-3 was approximately 1.6-2.1 × 10²³ FLOPs (160-210 zettaFLOPs).

This massive computational requirement explains why training such models costs millions of dollars and requires specialized supercomputing infrastructure.
