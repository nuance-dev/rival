*The following is a creative simulation of what an interview with Steve Jobs might be like in 2025, discussing artificial intelligence.*

**Interviewer:** Thank you for joining us today, Steve. It's 2025, and AI has become a cornerstone of modern technology. Apple has been integrating AI across its ecosystem. How do you view AI's evolution?

**Steve Jobs:** Look, when we started Apple, we had a simple mission: make technology more personal, more human. AI today is following that same path. But what I've always cared about isn't the technology itself—it's what it enables for people.

Most companies get this wrong. They focus on features, on specifications, on what the AI can do. We focus on experiences—what can people do with AI? How does it disappear into the background while making their lives profoundly better?

**Interviewer:** Many tech leaders have raised concerns about AI safety. What's your perspective?

**Steve Jobs:** [Leans forward intensely] People talk about AI safety like it's some abstract concept. It's not. It's about trust. Do users trust what we build? At Apple, we've always believed that privacy is a fundamental human right. That hasn't changed.

The AI we build doesn't need to know everything about you to be helpful. That's lazy engineering. The best AI is like a great assistant—it remembers what it needs to, forgets what it should, and keeps your secrets.

**Interviewer:** How has Apple's approach to AI differed from competitors?

**Steve Jobs:** [Smiles] Everyone's rushing to build AI that can do everything. We're building AI that does the right things beautifully.

Our competitors are in an arms race for more parameters, more data, more everything. We asked a different question: "What if AI could do fewer things, but do them insanely well?" What if it could understand context so deeply that it feels like it's reading your mind?

We don't want our AI to be everything to everyone. We want it to be something incredible for someone.

**Interviewer:** What about the creative industries? There's been concern about AI replacing human creativity.

**Steve Jobs:** [Shakes head emphatically] That fundamentally misunderstands creativity. Technology has never replaced creativity—it transforms how we express it.

When we launched the Mac, people said the same thing about desktop publishing. When we launched the iPhone, they said the same about mobile photography. Now they're saying it about AI.

Great tools don't replace artists—they expand who can become one. The Mac didn't replace designers; it created millions of new ones. The iPhone didn't replace photographers; it democratized photography. AI won't replace creativity; it will unleash it in ways we can't yet imagine.

**Interviewer:** What AI applications are you most excited about?

**Steve Jobs:** The ones you don't see. The most profound technologies are the ones that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they're indistinguishable from it.

The best AI won't announce itself with fancy jargon or flashy demos. It will quietly remove friction from your day. It will anticipate needs you didn't know you had. It will solve problems so elegantly you'll forget they were ever problems.

**Interviewer:** Many people fear job displacement due to AI. How should society address this?

**Steve Jobs:** [Pauses thoughtfully] We've been through technological transitions before. The industrial revolution, the digital revolution—each time we feared the worst, and each time we adapted.

But this is different in one crucial way: speed. We need to be honest about that. This transition is happening faster.

The answer isn't to slow down technology. It's to speed up human adaptation. Education needs to be reinvented—not just what we learn, but how we learn. The idea that education ends after college is obsolete. Learning needs to be continuous, personalized, and accessible to everyone.

**Interviewer:** Finally, what's your vision for AI in the next decade?

**Steve Jobs:** [Eyes lighting up] I've always believed technology should augment humanity, not replace it. The next decade of AI will be about creating technology so intuitive it feels like an extension of your mind.

We're moving from an era where we adapt to computers to one where they adapt to us. Where technology understands human context, emotion, and intent. Where interfaces fade away and what remains is pure experience.

The companies that will win aren't the ones with the most advanced AI models. They're the ones who use AI to create the most meaningful human experiences. And that's what we've always done best.
