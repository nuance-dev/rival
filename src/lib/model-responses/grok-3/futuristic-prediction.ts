  content: `By 2035, AI is poised to revolutionize the film industry in ways that amplify creativity, cut costs, and blur the lines between reality and fiction. Let’s break it down across deepfakes, AI actors, and script generation.

**Deepfakes**: These will evolve beyond today’s uncanny-valley experiments into seamless, real-time tools for storytelling. Studios could use advanced deepfake tech to "resurrect" deceased actors for new roles—imagine Humphrey Bogart starring in a 2035 neo-noir, with full legal consent from estates, of course. Aging actors might license their younger likenesses, letting Tom Cruise perform stunts as his 1990s self indefinitely. Post-production will lean heavily on this too: directors could tweak performances after shooting, altering emotions or dialogue without reshoots. The catch? Audiences might demand "deepfake-free" certifications to ensure authenticity, and legal battles over likeness rights will explode, especially for non-consenting individuals caught in indie or malicious projects.

**AI Actors**: Fully synthetic performers will hit mainstream screens by 2035. Think less Siri-with-a-face and more dynamic entities trained on vast datasets of human behavior, capable of improvisation within a director’s vision. Studios might cast "digital stars" like an AI-crafted femme fatale who never ages, never demands a salary, and licenses her image for merch. Smaller productions could afford blockbuster-level casts, leveling the playing field—your indie filmmaker might pit an AI Meryl Streep against an AI Chris Hemsworth for peanuts. Traditional actors won’t vanish, though; the human touch will carry a premium, much like vinyl in the streaming era. Unions like SAG-AFTRA will fight tooth and nail over job losses, potentially forcing quotas for human roles.

**Script Generation**: AI will churn out first drafts faster than a caffeine-fueled writer’s room. By 2035, tools like GPT successors could ingest a premise—“sci-fi western with a rogue AI sheriff”—and spit out a polished script, complete with dialogue tailored to specific actor styles. Human writers will shift toward curation, refining AI output for emotional depth or cultural nuance machines still can’t nail. Blockbusters might use AI to A/B test dozens of plot variations with focus groups in days, not months. The downside? A flood of formulaic content as lazy studios lean on predictable algorithms—think endless Marvel clones. Originality will become the holy grail, with auteurs wielding AI as a collaborator, not a crutch.

**Big Picture**: Production costs could plummet—less need for on-location shoots, human extras, or lengthy rewrites—democratizing filmmaking. A kid with a laptop might rival Hollywood’s output. Yet, the industry will grapple with authenticity crises: when everything’s possible, what’s real? Expect Oscars for "Best AI Performance" by 2035, alongside debates over whether a fully AI-made film "counts." Piracy might surge too, as deepfake tools let anyone slap Brad Pitt’s face on a bootleg flick. The winners will be those who blend AI’s power with human soul—think Christopher Nolan with an AI co-director, not a soulless algorithm churn.

That’s my take. What angle of this shift are you most curious about?`
