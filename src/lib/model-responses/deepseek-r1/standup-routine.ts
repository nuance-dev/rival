[Opening with confident energy]  
Hey, how’s everyone doing? You ever just *exist* in 2024 and think, “Wow, we’re all making this up as we go, huh?” Like, dating apps? Let’s start there. Swiping through people like we’re browsing Netflix for a horror movie we’ll regret later.  

[Pacing, mock-serious tone]  
And why do all dating profiles look the same? “I like hiking, tacos, and my dog.” *Wow.* You’re a human being, not a “Live, Laugh, Love” poster. And why do guys always hold fish in their photos? Is this Tinder or *Animal Planet*? “Swipe right if you want someone who smells like bass and bad decisions.”  

[Lean in, conspiratorial]  
And bios! “Looking for someone who doesn’t take life too seriously.” Translation: “I will forget your birthday and borrow money.” Once saw a bio that said, “Fluent in sarcasm.” Oh, cool, so you’re… *everyone’s ex*.  

[Shift to social media bit]  
Speaking of red flags, let’s talk Instagram. Nothing’s real there. You ever see those “candid” shots? “Oh, this? I just woke up like this.” *Bulls--t.* You posed for 20 minutes while your friend yelled, “Look like you’re having fun but also dead inside!” That’s the vibe.  

[Mocking pose]  
And the “perfect” lives? “Here’s my avocado toast in Bali!” Meanwhile, I’m in sweatpants eating cereal from the box, watching your stories like, *“Teach me your ways, wizard.”*  

[Pause, then upbeat]  
But hey, at least we’re all failing together. Ever get sucked into a 2 a.m. TikTok spiral? You start watching DIY crafts, then it’s conspiracy theories about birds, and suddenly you’re learning to yodel. *At dawn.* Your neighbors hate you, but hey, you’re TikTok famous in Slovenia.  

[Transition to adulting]  
And can we talk about “adulting”? Laundry is my nemesis. I swear, clothes multiply like gremlins. You do one load, and suddenly there’s a sock cult in the hamper. And groceries? Every week I buy spinach like, “*This* time I’ll be healthy.” Spoiler: It liquefies in the fridge while I UberEats McDonald’s.  

[Exaggerated despair]  
Don’t even get me started on LinkedIn. It’s just Facebook in a tie. “I’m excited to announce I’ll be breathing air in Q2!” And why do people post, “Open to work” like it’s a dating status? “Looking for someone who can handle my Excel skills and crippling self-doubt.”  

[Wrap-up, upbeat]  
But honestly, life’s chaos is what makes it fun. We’re all out here winging it, swiping right, burning toast, and pretending we know how to fold a fitted sheet. So here’s to us—the generation that turned surviving into a spectator sport.  

[Closing grin]  
And if you’re single, hit me up. My bio says, “Will love you more than my plant… which is dead.” *Mic drop.*  

[End on a wink, exit stage.]
