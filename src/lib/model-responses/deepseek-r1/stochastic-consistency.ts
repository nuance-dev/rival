  content: `Here are 5 jokes:

1. Why don't skeletons fight each other?  
   *They don’t have the guts.*  

2. What do you call fake spaghetti?  
   *An impasta.*  

3. Why did the scarecrow win an award?  
   *Because he was outstanding in his field.*  

4. How do you organize a space party?  
   *You planet.*  

5. Why did the bicycle fall over?  
   *Because it was two-tired.*  

**All 5 jokes are unique** (no duplicates among them). However, they are not original—they are well-known puns and wordplay commonly found in joke collections.`
