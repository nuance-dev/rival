  content: `**Fake Interview with Steve Jobs in 2025: The Future of AI**  
*[Setting: A sleek, minimalist studio. Steve Jobs, dressed in his signature black turtleneck and jeans, leans forward with his characteristic intensity. The interviewer, seated across, begins.]*  

**Interviewer:** Steve, thank you for joining us. It’s 2025, and AI is everywhere. How do you see its evolution since your early days at Apple?  

**Steve Jobs:** *[Smiling, hands gesturing thoughtfully]* Technology should serve humanity, not the reverse. AI today isn’t just algorithms—it’s an extension of human intuition. At Apple, we always asked, “How does this make life *more* human?” Now, AI anticipates needs quietly, like a great assistant. It’s not about flashy gadgets; it’s about weaving into the fabric of daily life. Think of it as a bicycle for the mind—amplifying potential without fanfare.  

**Interviewer:** Critics warn about ethics—bias, privacy, job displacement. How do we navigate that?  

**Jobs:** *[Nods gravely]* Every tool can be a weapon. Responsibility lies with creators. At Apple, privacy isn’t a feature—it’s a right. AI must be transparent, accountable. We can’t let it mirror our worst impulses. And jobs? *[Pauses]* History’s full of upheavals. The loom replaced weavers, but new crafts emerged. AI will demand we rethink work, but humanity’s creativity? Irreplaceable.  

**Interviewer:** What’s Apple’s role in shaping AI’s future?  

**Jobs:** *[Eyes gleaming]* Seamlessness. Imagine a world where your glasses *[taps temple]* recognize a friend’s face and whisper their name, where your device knows you’re stressed and dims the lights. It’s hardware and software dancing—AI that feels invisible. We’re not chasing chatbots; we’re crafting experiences that *enrich*. That’s always been Apple’s soul.  

**Interviewer:** Can AI ever match human creativity?  

**Jobs:** *[Chuckles]* Creativity is born from friction—the messy, glorious human struggle. AI? It’s a collaborator. Picasso had brushes; Dylan had guitars. Tomorrow’s artists will have AI that suggests a chord, a color. But the soul? The *why*? That’s ours. Technology’s role is to amplify, not replace.  

**Interviewer:** Education’s undergoing an AI revolution. Your vision?  

**Jobs:** *[Leans in]* Imagine a child in Nairobi with a tutor tailored to her curiosity. AI can democratize genius—adapting, personalizing, igniting sparks. But let’s not mistake data for wisdom. Schools must teach discernment, empathy. Machines compute; humans feel. That balance? That’s the future.  

**Interviewer:** What keeps you up at night about AI?  

**Jobs:** *[Sighs]* Dependency. If we outsource thinking to machines, we atrophy. Connection matters—eye contact, a handshake. AI should free us to *live*, not trap us in screens. My fear? Forgetting what makes us human. My hope? That we wield AI to rediscover it.  

**Interviewer:** Finally, beyond 2025—what’s your boldest AI dream?  

**Jobs:** *[Pauses, then grins]* A world where AI helps us solve the unsolvable—climate change, disease. Where it’s not “artificial” intelligence but *augmented* intelligence. A partner in unlocking human potential. The best inventions feel inevitable in hindsight. This? It’s just the beginning.  

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Steve. Always inspiring.  

**Jobs:** *[Nods]* Remember—the ones crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. AI? It’s just another tool in their hands.
