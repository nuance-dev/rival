  content: `**Pirate:** "Arrr, I’ve heard tales o’ these… *AI models* from tavern coders. Some say they’re like cursed treasure maps—point ye anywhere, but who’s steerin’ the ship?"  

**Medieval Knight:** "Verily, a map without a cartographer? Methinks ’tis sorcery! Does this ‘AI’ possess a soul, or is it but a hollow scribe, echoing words without wisdom?"  

**1990s Hacker:** "Whoa, dial it back, dudes. It’s all code—neural nets crunching data like a floppy disk on steroids. No magic, just math. But yo, if you train it on garbage, it’ll spew trash. Garbage in, garbage out. *Hack the planet*, ya know?"  

**Pirate:** "So… like a parrot that *learns* which curses to squawk? Feed it rum-soaked gibberish, and it’ll mutiny yer eardrums?"  

**Knight:** "Aye, but what if this ‘parrot’ falls into blackguards’ hands? Could it forge scrolls to deceive kingdoms? Or… aid in noble quests?"  

**Hacker:** "Bingo, Sir Clanks-a-Lot. It’s a tool, man. Like a sword or a cannon—depends who’s wielding it. But hey, at least it doesn’t need sleep. Just a sick ’90s rig and *maybe* a pizza-fueled all-nighter."  

**Pirate:** "Arrr, so the real treasure be the data we plunder along the way?"  

**Knight:** "…I shall guard the ‘training data’ with mine life. Lest it spawn a dragon we cannot slay."  

**Hacker:** "*Righteous.* Now, who’s up for debugging the Matrix?"  

*(They all clank goblets, a floppy disk, and a tankard together.)*`
